## Description
This repository contains code used to simulate and score libraries used in Lane et al., 2015. If you use anthing from this repository, please cite us!

## Using this repository
[Start here](https://github.com/eatingcrispr/VirtualEating/blob/master/Simulating%20and%20generating%203MB%20Xenopus%20library/VirtualEating.ipynb) for code related to generating the guides used in imaging of the single locus on *X. laevis* 
chromosome 4 shown in Figure 3 (or look under "Simulating and generating 3MB Xenopus library"). This iPython notebook also gives instructions on the adaptation of the code for other purposes.

[Start here](https://github.com/eatingcrispr/VirtualEating/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20E.%20coli%20library/HiSeq%20Part%201%20-%20Read%20analysis.ipynb) for code related to analysis of HiSeq results on the *E. coli* genomic library described in Figure 4 (or check under "Analysis of E. coli library"). Reads are available as a part of a BioProject [PRJNA286003](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/286003).
